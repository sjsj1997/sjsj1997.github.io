Happy customizing!\n\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/oerview/menus/","title":"Menus","parent":"Usage","content":"The theme supports two different kinds of menus. File-tree menu is the default one and does not require further configuration to work. If you want full control about your menu the bundle menu is a powerful option to accomplish it.\n   File-tree menu Bundle menu  More menu       File-tree menu As the name already suggests, the file tree menu builds a menu from the file system structure of the content folder. By default, areas and subareas are sorted alphabetically by the title of the pages. To manipulate the order the weight parameter in a page front matter can be used. To structure your content folder you have to use page bundles, single files are not supported. Hugo will render build single files in the content folder just fine but it will not be added to the menu.\nExample:\nFile system structure:\ncontent/ ├── level-1 │ ├── _index.md │ ├── level-1-1.md │ ├── level-1-2.md │ └── level-1-3 │ ├── _index.md │ └── level-1-3-1.md └── level-2 ├── _index.md ├── level-2-1.md └── level-2-2.md \nBundle menu This type of navigation needs to be enabled first by setting geekdocMenuBundle to true in your site configuration. After you have activated the bundle menu, you start with an empty navigation. This is intentional because bundle menus have to be defined manually in a data file. While this increases the effort it also offers maximum flexibility in the design. The data file needs to be written in YAML and placed at data/menu/main.yml.\nExample:\n---main:- name:Level 1ref:\u0026#34;/level-1\u0026#34;icon:\u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;sub:- name:Level 1.1ref:\u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-1\u0026#34;- name:Level 1.2ref:\u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-2\u0026#34;- name:Level 1.3ref:\u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-3\u0026#34;sub:- name:Level 1.3.1ref:\u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-3/level-1-3-1\u0026#34;- name:Level 2ref:\u0026#34;/level-2\u0026#34;sub:- name:Level 2.1ref:\u0026#34;/level-2/level-2-1\u0026#34;- name:Level 2.2ref:\u0026#34;/level-2/level-2-2\u0026#34;As an advantage you can add icons to your menu entries e.g. icon: \u0026quot;notification\u0026quot;.\n\nMore menu Tip\nThe more menu is special type of the bundle menu and can be combined with the default file-tree menu.  As this is a special type of the bundle menu it is basically working in the same way. To enable it just add a data file to data/menu/more.yml. The more menu will also work with the file-tree menu and therefor don\u0026rsquo;t need to be enabled by the geekdocMenuBundle parameter.\nExample:\n---more:- name:Newsref:\u0026#34;/#\u0026#34;icon:\u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;- name:Releasesref:\u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc/releases\u0026#34;external:trueicon:\u0026#34;download\u0026#34;- name:\u0026#34;View Source\u0026#34;ref:\u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc\u0026#34;external:trueicon:\u0026#34;github\u0026#34;\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/shortcodes/buttons/","title":"Buttons","parent":"Shortcodes","content":"Buttons are styled links that can lead to local page or external link.\n{{\u0026lt; button relref=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [class=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34;] \u0026gt;}}Get Home{{\u0026lt; /button \u0026gt;}}{{\u0026lt; button href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}Contribute{{\u0026lt; /button \u0026gt;}}Example  Get Home   Contribute   "},{"id":14,"href":"/shortcodes/columns/","title":"Columns","parent":"Shortcodes","content":"Columns help organize shorter pieces of content horizontally for readability.\n{{\u0026lt; columns \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;!-- begin columns block --\u0026gt; # Left Content Dolor sit, sumo unique argument um no ... \u0026lt;---\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- magic sparator, between columns --\u0026gt; # Mid Content Dolor sit, sumo unique argument um no ... \u0026lt;---\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- magic sparator, between columns --\u0026gt; # Right Content Dolor sit, sumo unique argument um no ... {{\u0026lt; /columns \u0026gt;}} Example Left Dolor sit, sumo unique argument um no.
